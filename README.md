# Compressor_Fault_Diagnosis
This project deals with detection and diagnosis of 7 faults of a reciprocating compressor using acoustic signals. After feature extraction, various machine learning algorithms are utilized to classify the faults.

# Instruction for using the codes
The main file for execution of program is "main.py" existed in the "Code" folder. All other files are moduels defined for different purposes. The data is from an open dataset available in the web. A part of the dataset is located in the "Data.rar" archive, on that basis the codes can be executed. The dataset belongs to the following article:
Verma, N. K., Sevakula, R. K., Dixit, S., & Salour, A. (2015). Intelligent condition based monitoring using acoustic signals for air compressors. IEEE Transactions on Reliability, 65(1), 291-309. DOI: https://doi.org/10.1109/TR.2015.2459684
